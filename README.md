#Expirience
- If you want to join some Room you should know the Room ID, or you can visit any Room and just tell the Room Id to your mates.
- The chat box is a resizable block for desktop and static for mobile
- Any message stored nowhere. Creating and joining user to room went through socket.io and erase after reloading page.
